<h3>I have made a slack bot that notifies vaccine status using the Cowin API to make booking vaccine easier.</h3>
</div>

```diff
ENV stuff:
+ Create .env file
+ Add the following to the .env file:
  - Your slack bot token as SLACK_TOKEN.
  - Minimum age limit as MIN_AGE_LIMIT.
  - Your district code as DISTRICT_CODE.
  - Optional: If you have specific area in mind that you want to be present in address then add it as AREA.
```

```diff
- NOTE: This does not book vaccine slots
